Parsed HTML into JSON and CSV. All Cubeville Banned players.  
_Probably nobody needs this..._  
I'll post the code... but not now. sorry (code is posted, check out parse.py)  
I'm not related to Cubeville staff, btw

Do `pip install -r requirements.txt`

CSV value separator = \t, CSV row separator = \n :D

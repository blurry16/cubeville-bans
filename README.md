# Literally archivation notice

So I'm not going to make it as a GitHub archive just because if you'd like contribute to the code you can use issues or
pull requests. Anyways, I'm not going to update .json and .csv files. Feel free to contact me
in [Telegram](https://t.me/blurry16).

# WARNING: Players banned for inappropriate names will feature on this list. If you are uncomfortable with seeing them, do not scroll through bans.json and bans.csv

Parsed HTML into JSON and CSV. All Cubeville Banned players.  
_Probably nobody needs this..._  
I'll post the code... but not now. sorry (code is posted, check out parse.py)  
I'm not related to Cubeville staff, btw

Do `pip install -r requirements.txt`

CSV value separator = \t, CSV row separator = \n :D

Enjoy.
